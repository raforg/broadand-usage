broadband-usage - Home broadband usage meter for SNMP-enabled modem/routers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This software meters the traffic on an SNMP-enabled broadband modem/router
and then lets you find out your usage by calendar month. It's main purpose
is to let you know what your usage is without having to resort to your ISP's
website and without having to trust their accounting. If they get their
accounting wrong (which can happen), this software gives you data that you
might be able to use when contesting the invoice.

Features
--------
Tiny: 9KB download, 18KB footprint (plus ~140KB per month for the logfile)
Easy: The only pre-requisites are perl and snmpget which you probably have
Smart: Handles modem/router reboots, 32/64bit counter overflow, uptime overflow
Pragmatic: Counts peak/off-peak usage separately; Report in GB or GiB
Free: Released under the terms of the GPL (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html)

Description
-----------
This software takes the form of two scripts. The first, broadband-usage-log,
logs data to file. The second, broadband-usage, reports on the logged data.

broadband-usage-log
-------------------
This program obtains traffic statistics via SNMP and saves it to file.
Cron it to run every 15 minutes and at 23:59:59 every day.
There is one file per modem/router interface. You will probably only
need one file for home use.

broadband-usage
---------------
This program displays monthly totals for the routers and interfaces
that have been logged by broadband-usage-log. Typically this will be
a single router (your broadband modem/router) and a single interface
(the WAN interface). Delete or compress old logfiles if you don't want
them appearing in its output.

Why?
----
MRTG shows average throughput, not total usage, and I'm told it doesn't
work on calendar months, and my broadband service is based on calendar
months. I just wanted something that would tell me how much of my monthly
bandwidth I had used (i.e. something independent of my broadband service
provider).

I searched freshmeat, sourceforge and google but found nothing suitable
(or if they were suitable, I never found out because I gave up when the
list of prerequisite software grew out of control). It seemed the easiest
solution was to just write a couple of little perl scripts that did what
I wanted.

Install
-------
First, make sure that you have snmpget and that it works.
If you don't have it, you can get it from:

  http://www.net-snmp.org/download/

Then, install the broadband-usage software (under /usr/local by default):

  $ make install [prefix=/usr/local] # as root

Then, add the following to your crontab:

  0,15,30,45 * * * * /usr/local/bin/broadband-usage-log -r router -i2
  59 23 * * * sleep 59; /usr/local/bin/broadband-usage-log -r router -i2

Where "router" is the hostname of your broadband modem/router,
and "2" is the numeric index of its WAN interface. The snmpwalk
program can help you find out which interface is the WAN interface.
You can log multiple interfaces by using a comma separated list of
interface numbers with the -i option.

Finally, some time later, you will be able to see your broadband usage:

 $ /usr/local/bin/broadband-usage
 200601.router.2 in=832249062 out=19478166 total=832249062 (832.249MB)

Or even have cron mail it to you every month by adding this to your crontab:

  5 0 1 * * /usr/local/bin/broadband-usage

Further Reading
---------------
Run the manpages of both programs for more important information
including advice on how often broadband-usage-log should be run
depending on the link speed.

Example
-------
Here is the broadband-usage-related part of my crontab:

 # Log broadband usage every 15 minutes and at 23:59:59 every day
 0,15,30,45 * * * * /usr/local/bin/broadband-usage-log -r moriarty -i 102
 59 23 * * * sleep 59; /usr/local/bin/broadband-usage-log -r moriarty -i 102
 # Save broadband usage report into the broadband log directory
 5 0 1 * * /usr/local/bin/broadband-usage -o 0100-1000 > /var/log/broadband/`date +%Y%m%d`-usage
 # Compress broadband usage logs after a month, delete them after three months
 0 0 1 * * find /var/log/broadband -mtime +32 -a -name '*[0-9]' -exec gzip '{}' ';'
 0 0 1 * * find /var/log/broadband -mtime +92 -a -name '*.gz' -exec rm '{}' ';'
